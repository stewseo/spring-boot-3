## Develop a Spring Boot web application that can serve dynamic content and interact with third-party apps through a JSON-based API.

### This project aims to accomplish its goal by:
- Injecting demo data using a service: Set up a service to inject demo data into the application. This data will be used to populate the dynamic content on the web pages.
- Creating a web controller that uses Mustache: Use Mustache, a templating engine, to render dynamic content based on the demo data. The controller will retrieve the data from the service and pass it to the Mustache templates to render the web pages.
- Creating a JSON-based API: Develop a JSON-based API that allows third-party apps to interact with the web application. The API can be used to retrieve data or send updates to the application.
- Leveraging Node.js: To introduce some JavaScript to the web application, use a Gradle plugin to incorporate Node.js. This will allow for additional functionality to be added to the application, such as client-side scripting or server-side logic.


### Creating a Spring MVC web controller

Web controllers are bits of code that respond to HTTP requests. These can comprise an HTTP GET/request that is asking for the root URL. Most websites respond with some HTML. But web controllers can also answer requests for APIs that yield JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), such as HTTP GET /api/videos. Furthermore, web controllers do the heavy lifting of transporting provided JSON when the user is affecting change with an HTTP POST.

Spring MVC is Spring Framework’s module that lets us build web apps on top of servlet-based containers using the Model-View-Controller(MVC) paradigm.

This dependency puts Spring MVC on our project’s classpath and gives us access to Spring MVC’s annotations and other components, allowing us to define web controllers. Its presence will trigger Spring Boot’s autoconfiguration settings to activate any web controller we create.
