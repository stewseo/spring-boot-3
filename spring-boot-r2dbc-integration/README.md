## Working with data reactively

### Objectives
- Learn how to fetch data reactively: The code aims to implement reactive programming to fetch data asynchronously and reactively, which differs from traditional imperative programming. The code utilizes reactive streams to process the data.
- Select an appropriate reactive data store: The code helps the user select an appropriate reactive data store, such as NoSQL databases, for their application. The code compares the features and performance of different reactive data stores.
- Create a reactive data repository: The code shows how to create a reactive data repository using Spring Data, which provides a consistent way to interact with various data stores. The code defines queries and database operations using annotations.
- Test R2DBC: The code demonstrates the use of R2DBC, a reactive SQL database driver, to interact with a relational database reactively. The code sets up a database connection and performs database operations using R2DBC, highlighting its benefits.

### Purpose
- Demonstrate how to work with data reactively using Spring Boot. This involves understanding reactive programming concepts, selecting a reactive data store, creating a reactive data repository with Spring Data, and using R2DBC for reactive SQL database interactions.

### Functional Goals:
- Learn how to fetch data reactively
  - Definition: Implement reactive programming to fetch data asynchronously and reactively using reactive streams.
  - Explanation: This goal focuses on the functionality of the code, which is to fetch data in a reactive way using reactive streams. The implementation of reactive programming and reactive streams is a functional aspect of the code.
- Select an appropriate reactive data store
  - Definition: Help the user choose the best reactive data store, such as NoSQL databases, based on features and performance.
  - Explanation: The goal here is to provide a functional capability to the user by assisting them in selecting the best reactive data store for their application based on features and performance. This is a functional requirement because it enables the user to make an informed decision about the data store they will use.
- Create a reactive data repository
  - Definition: Create a reactive data repository using Spring Data to interact with various data stores consistently, using annotations to define queries and database operations.
  - Explanation: This goal involves the functional implementation of creating a reactive data repository using Spring Data. The repository provides a consistent way to interact with various data stores, and annotations are used to define queries and database operations. These are functional requirements of the code.
- Test R2DBC
  - Definition: Use R2DBC, a reactive SQL database driver, to interact with a relational database reactively and highlight its benefits.
  - Explanation: This goal involves the functional testing of R2DBC, a reactive SQL database driver, to interact with a relational database reactively. The code sets up a database connection and performs database operations using R2DBC, highlighting its benefits. This is a functional requirement because it tests the functionality of the R2DBC driver and demonstrates its benefits.

### Behavioral Goals:
- "Fetch data reactively"
  - Definition: To implement reactive programming techniques to fetch data asynchronously and reactively using reactive streams, rather than traditional imperative programming.
  - Explanation: This goal is behavioral because it emphasizes the process of fetching data in a reactive way, using specific programming techniques and tools, rather than just achieving a functional outcome (e.g., fetching data successfully).
- "Select an appropriate reactive data store"
  - Definition: To identify and select an appropriate reactive data store, such as a NoSQL database, based on its features and performance characteristics.
  - Explanation: This goal is behavioral because it involves making a specific decision (selecting a reactive data store) based on certain criteria (features and performance), rather than just achieving a functional outcome (e.g., storing data successfully).
- "Create a reactive data repository"
  - Definition: To create a reactive data repository using Spring Data, which provides a consistent way to interact with various data stores, and define queries and database operations using annotations.
  - Explanation: This goal is behavioral because it involves a specific process (creating a reactive data repository) using specific tools and techniques (Spring Data and annotations), rather than just achieving a functional outcome (e.g., accessing data successfully).
- "Test R2DBC"
  - Definition: To demonstrate the use of R2DBC, a reactive SQL database driver, to interact with a relational database reactively, including setting up a database connection and performing database operations using R2DBC.
  - Explanation: This goal is behavioral because it involves a specific process (testing R2DBC) using specific tools and techniques (R2DBC and database operations), rather than just achieving a functional outcome (e.g., connecting to a database successfully).
