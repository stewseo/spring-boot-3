### Reactive Programming in Spring Boot 3

### Objectives:
### Purpose:
### Functional Goals:
- Understand the concept and significance of reactive programming.
  - Definition: To provide developers with an understanding of reactive programming and its importance in modern software development.
  - Explanation: This goal is considered functional because it provides developers with the knowledge needed to effectively use reactive programming in their Spring Boot applications.
- Develop a Spring Boot application that incorporates reactive programming.
  - Definition: To enable developers to create a Spring Boot application that effectively utilizes reactive programming.
  - Explanation: This goal is considered functional because it involves creating a tangible end product, a Spring Boot application, that incorporates reactive programming.
- Create a reactive GET method to serve data.
  - Definition: To demonstrate how to create a GET method that serves data reactively.
  - Explanation: This goal is considered functional because it involves creating a specific function within the code, a reactive GET method, that serves a specific purpose, retrieving and serving data.
- Implement a reactive POST method to consume incoming data.
  - Definition: To demonstrate how to implement a POST method that consumes incoming data reactively.
  - Explanation: This goal is considered functional because it involves creating a specific function within the code, a reactive POST method, that serves a specific purpose, consuming incoming data.
- Use Spring HATEOAS to generate a hypermedia-aware API reactively. Additionally, leverage Thymeleaf to create a reactive template and use it as a reactive templating engine to create an HTML frontend.
  - Definition: To demonstrate how to create a hypermedia-aware API using Spring HATEOAS and a reactive template using Thymeleaf as a reactive templating engine.
  - Explanation: This goal is considered functional because it involves creating a specific end product, a hypermedia-aware API and a reactive HTML frontend, using specific tools and techniques, Spring HATEOAS and Thymeleaf.
