 * - Handles mapped HTTP POST /api/employees calls in the add() method that processes and deserializes the incoming request body into an Employee object only when the system is ready,
 *    ensures a completely new entry will be made to the database, and returns the result Mono<Employee> from the executed save operation with a newly created Employee object inside
